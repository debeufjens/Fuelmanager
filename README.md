**Fuelmanager**

Fuelmanager is an integrated system that gives car owners more insights about their fuel consumption and fuel costs.

By installing a simple plug and play module and connecting it to your smartphone, you wil see lots of information about your fuel usage, fuel costs and even an overview of all recent routes you have driven.

Being based on an ESP32, Raspberry Pi 4 and an OBD2 bluetooth reader makes Fuelmanager cheap and easy to recreate and use.

Optionally you can use a HDMI Screen to see some real-time data while driving on the road.

In September 2020 I started at Howest Kortrijk in Belgium, there my Bachelors Degree adventure started. At the end of the 2nd semester we needed to implement everything we had learned so far in a 'project'. Because I really like cars and everything about them I started looking into projects with cars.

This is how Fuelmanager was born.
